## How Integrative psychotherapists work with clients with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder.

### The research
I work from a relational and developmental perspective and am interested in how other Integrative psychotherapists work with clients who present with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

### About me
I am an accredited therapist in private practice and studying for an MSc in Integrative Psychotherapy with The Sherwood Psychotherapy Institute in Nottingham, UK.

### About you
I am wanting to interview qualified psychotherapists with experience of working with clients who have a diagnosis of BPD.

### When
Interviews from July 2020.

### Where
Nottingham city centre, online via video, or at another mutually agreeable location.

### For more information
If you are interested in taking part or have any questions about the research then please get in touch.
