## From Diagnosis Towards a Developmental and Relational approach to Borderline Personality Disorder
## _How Integrative psychotherapists work with clients with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder._

### How do Integrative psychotherapists, in the early stages of therapy, work with clients who present with a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder?

I am conducting a grounded theory research project that will aim to explore your work with clients who have a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder.

This research project will form my dissertation for my final year of study of my MSc in Integrative Psychotherapy at the Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute (SPTI). Following successful completion of the master’s degree, and if accepted and with participants consent, participants' involvement will also contribute to a peer-reviewed journal article. 

This study will be conducted within the SPTI Ethical Guidelines for Counselling Research and Psychotherapy and the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy’s (BACP) Ethical guidelines for researching counselling and psychotherapy (both available on request) at all times and will be monitored and supervised by my course tutors and programme director within SPTI.

### I am particularly interested to find out...

* How do therapists conceptualise the Borderline Personality Disorder Diagnosis?
* What theories inform this conceptualisation?
* Is this shared with the client, and if so, how?
* How does this then shape the therapy or any specific interventions?
* What are the perceived benefits of reformulating the diagnosis in this way?
* Does this process differ from work with other (non-BPD diagnosis) clients?

### Want to be involved?
